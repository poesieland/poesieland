# Pilgrim

Pilgrim, how you journey

on the road you chose

to find out where the winds die

and where the stories go.

All days come from one day

that must you must know,

you cannot change what's over

but only where you go.


One way leads to diamonds,

one way leads to gold,

another leads you only

to everything you're told.

In your heart you wonder

which of these is true;

the road that leads to nowhere,

the road that leads to you.


Will you find the answer

in all you say and do?

Will you find the answer

in you?


Each heart is a pilgrim,

each one wants to know

the reason why the winds die

and where the stories go.

Pilgrim, in your journey

you may travel far,

for pilgrim it's a long way

to find out who you are...


Pilgrim, it's a long way

to find out who you are...
