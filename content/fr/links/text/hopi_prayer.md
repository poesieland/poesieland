# Hopy Prayer

Do not stand

at my grave and weep.

I am not there,

I do not sleep.

I am a thousand

winds that blow

I am the diamond

glints on snow.

I am the sunlight

on the ripened grain.

I am the gentle

Autumn's rain.

When you awaken

in the morning hush,

I am the swift

uplifting rushk,

of quiet birds in

circled flight,

I am the

soft stars that

shine at night.

Do not stand

at my grave

and cry:

I am not there,

I did not die.
