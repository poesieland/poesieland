If you ever visited the French section, you may wonder why I divided my poetic art into "Seasons". I first thought it was an easy way to browse my poems, and after this, took some time to rearrange the site and add category browsing. Anyway, the word isn't innocent, it lets you think of your own life, its never straight line. Each coming year gives you other joys and feelings. However, only a few poems are translated.

In this section, even though there are a lot fewer poems, the sensibility is the same: openness to life, sharing and feelings frankness.
