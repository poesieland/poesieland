At the cemetery last row

I'll have my grave under the flowers:

I do not require any prayer

And I do not want even one of your tears.


Then when your slow step lengthens

You will find in scattered strands

This tenderness, which prolongs

The most disconcerting of my departures.


Dream's spring carries itself

To flower our happiness again:

Let's hide with a gesture too much sorrow;

At the bottom of yours vibrates my heart!


With a remote memory you rock

This unisons evanescence:

Embrace the flowers you are pouring:

You know, their petals say songs!


If you come in the next autumn

Shell a rosary of hope:

The shade rebounds and then resounds

In our peace until the great evening.
