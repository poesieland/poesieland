## Site history

- 2023: abandoning hand-made stuff, website now uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) as a site building framework and [hugo-theme-relearn](https://github.com/McShelby/hugo-theme-relearn) for theming. New back-office tool to generate content pages (XML to markdown)

- 2005 : use of XHTML 1.1 strict to replace HTML 4.01 transitional. Started working on a visual back-office tool but never achieved it

- 2004: modernization of HTML structure (floating divs)

- 2003: XML offline generation allowed to better structure the French part

- mid-2001: site opening
