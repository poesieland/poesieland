## Site history

- 2023: abandoning hand-made stuff, website now uses *Hugo* as a site building framework and *hugo-theme-relearn* for theming (see [Credits](../more/credits/)). New back-office tool to generate content pages (XML to markdown)

- 2005 : use of XHTML 1.1 strict to replace HTML 4.01 transitional. Started working on a visual back-office tool but never achieved it

- 2004: modernization of HTML structure (floating divs)

- 2003: XML offline generation allowed to better structure the French part

- mid-2001: site opening
