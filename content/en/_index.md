Welcome... in the bottom of my "poetic kingdom"...

Though most of my poems are in French, my mother tongue, some are in English. Sometimes I wrote poems directly in English, sometimes I find it useful to translate a French-written poem to share with a friend. You may find some in Italian too, they'll be marked.

If you ever visited the French section, you may wonder why I divided my poetic art into "Seasons". The word isn't innocent, it lets you think of your own life, its never straight line. Each coming year gives you other joys and feelings.

In this section, even though there are a lot fewer poems, the sensibility is the same: openness to life, sharing and feelings frankness.

A contemporary poet, Evelina Jarosz Clark, wrote on August 4th, 2001:

> A poem is like a kiss.

> It begins
> \
> In the heart,
> \
> Quietly,
> \
> Like a wish,
> \
> And needs only
> \
> One other
> \
> To be complete.

Have a great trip...
