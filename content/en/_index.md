Welcome to the bottom of my "poetic kingdom".

In early 2000's I sometimes felt inspired enough to craft [poems in English](./original_texts), rather my mother tongue French. But the feelings are of the same kind, philosophy, a bit of tenderness, looking at my past.

In 2024, suddenly I wrote again one poem in English, thus enjoying finding out how I feel inspired in this case, there are two cases, either there are not words and their rythm that comes first to mind but pictures I mentally walk into and describe. Or like in French words playing musically some meaning.

There is even a [single poem written in Italian](./original_texts/2001/shalom_veor).

If you like "regular" poetry, head to the [French poems](/fr/seasons) and enjoy them helping yourself with [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com).

When you visit them, you may wonder why I divided my poetic art into "Seasons". The word isn't innocent, it lets you think of your own life, its never straight line. Each coming year gives you renewed joys and feelings.

A contemporary poet, Evelina Jarosz Clark, wrote on August 4th, 2001:

> A poem is like a kiss.
> \
> It begins
> \
> In the heart,
> \
> Quietly,
> \
> Like a wish,
> \
> And needs only
> \
> One other
> \
> To be complete.

Have a great trip
