Welcome... in the bottom of my "poetic kingdom"...

Though most of my poems are in French, my mother tongue, some are in English. If you enter here you have a direct access to the translated or originally in English written texts. You may find some in Italian too, they'll be marked.

Have a great trip...

Up to now, there is any English language book to foresee. Why not thinking of some French-speaking friend or even invite yourself to (re)discover my mother tongue? (edited French book).

On technical side, this website is up since mid-2001, but evolved for more ease of use : first in February 2003 when XML offline generation allowed to better structure the French part, second one year later when inelegant framing was removed by use of PHP. And I created a web-based back-office in 2005 to complete command-line XML transformation calls by some features. Enjoy.

A contemporary poet, Evelina Jarosz Clark, wrote on August 4th, 2001:

A poem is like a kiss.
It begins
In the heart,
Quietly,
Like a wish,
And needs only
One other
To be complete.
