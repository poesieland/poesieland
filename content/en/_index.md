Welcome to the bottom of my "poetic kingdom"

Sometimes, instead of my mother tongue which is French, I directly wrote poems in English. You'll even find one original poem in Italian too.

In early 2000's I also found it useful to translate some French-written poems to share with a friend. But I finally think that [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com) is nowadays effective enough. So head to the [French poems](/seasons) and enjoy.

When you visit them, you may wonder why I divided my poetic art into "Seasons". The word isn't innocent, it lets you think of your own life, its never straight line. Each coming year gives you other joys and feelings.

In this section, even though there are a lot fewer poems, the sensibility is the same: openness to life, sharing and feelings frankness.

A contemporary poet, Evelina Jarosz Clark, wrote on August 4th, 2001:

> A poem is like a kiss.
> \
> It begins
> \
> In the heart,
> \
> Quietly,
> \
> Like a wish,
> \
> And needs only
> \
> One other
> \
> To be complete.

Have a great trip
