Welcome... in the bottom of my "poetic kingdom"...

Though most of my poems are in French, my mother tongue, some are in English. If you enter here you have a direct access to the translated or originally in English written texts. You may find some in Italian too, they'll be marked.

Have a great trip...

If you ever visited the French section, you may wonder why I divided my poetic art into "Seasons". I first thought it was an easy way to browse my poems, and after this, took some time to rearrange the site and add category browsing. Anyway, the word isn't innocent, it lets you think of your own life, its never straight line. Each coming year gives you other joys and feelings. However, only a few poems are translated.

In this section, even though there are a lot fewer poems, the sensibility is the same: openness to life, sharing and feelings frankness.

Up to now, there is any English language book to foresee. Why not thinking of some French-speaking friend or even invite yourself to (re)discover my mother tongue? (edited French book).

On technical side, this website is up since mid-2001, but evolved for more ease of use : first in February 2003 when XML offline generation allowed to better structure the French part, second one year later when inelegant framing was removed by use of PHP. And I created a web-based back-office in 2005 to complete command-line XML transformation calls by some features. Enjoy.

A contemporary poet, Evelina Jarosz Clark, wrote on August 4th, 2001:

A poem is like a kiss.
It begins
In the heart,
Quietly,
Like a wish,
And needs only
One other
To be complete.
